## Johni A. Kim

Hello, my name is Johni Kim. I have been designing, developing, managing, modeling, architecting, and imagineering data driven solutions for quite some time.  I believe my special area of skill is understanding business requirements and needs, and translating those into technology solutions.  

I believe that a good query, a good data structure, a good database design, a good application, a good system architecture will open up possibilities.  Your solution should not only solve the problem/question at hand, but it should bring about new ideas.

Note: I have recently started adding projects to GitHub. All my previous work utilized repositories that are confidential, or they are in a different type of repository (VSS, SVN, custom libraries).  As I find time I will be curating these and adding appropriate and useful projects.  Some of the framework is already laid out under [Personal Projects](https://github.com/JohniAKim/PersonalProjects).
