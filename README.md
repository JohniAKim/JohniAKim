## Johni A. Kim

Hello, my name is Johni Kim. I have been designing, developing, managing, modeling, architecting, and imagineering data driven solutions for quite some time.  I believe my special area of skill is understanding business requirements and needs, and translating those into technology solutions.  

I believe that a good query, a good data structure, a good database design, a good application, a good system architecture will open up possibilities.  Your solution should not only solve the problem/question at hand, but it should bring about new ideas.

## Shout Outs!

Below is a list of people and organizations that have provided me with inspiration, guidance or useful knowlege.

I will be continually adding to this list.

- Edgar Codd and Chris Date - these gents started all my feelz about relationships and normalizing things.
- Rodman Smith - whose patience allowed a young man to get out of his own head and learn from a quality engineer.
- [Josh Starmer Phd (StatQuest)](https://www.youtube.com/c/joshstarmer) - Does anybody explain stats or ML better?
- [Graeme C. Simsion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graeme_Simsion) - who wrote the first data modeling book I ever read, [Data Modeling Essentials](https://www.amazon.com/Modeling-Essentials-Third-Graeme-Simsion/dp/0126445516), and set me on my initial path.
- ...much more to come...
